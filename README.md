# NX Workspace diff

This repository exposes an [Nrwl NX](https://github.com/nrwl/nx) workspace generated with
`create-nx-workspace my-workspace` with each version of Nrwl NX .

A dedicated branch per version makes changes very easy
to watch. For example:

* https://github.com/beeman/nx-workspace-diff/compare/0.6.7...0.11.0
* https://github.com/beeman/nx-workspace-diff/compare/0.8.0...1.0.3

See table below for the complete list.

Thanks to [cexbrayat/angular-cli-diff](https://github.com/cexbrayat/angular-cli-diff) for letting 
me copy his repo :) !

## Why this repository ?

After an upgrade of Nrwl NX on your project, you'll have to keep the configuration up-to-date, and it can be hard to keep track.

This project lets you easily know what changed. For example, from
[0.8.0 to the 1.0.3](https://github.com/beeman/nx-workspace-diff/compare/0.8.0...1.0.3).

This is a copy of the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/cexbrayat/angular-cli-diff) version.
